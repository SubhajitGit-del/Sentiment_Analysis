# 🎭 Emotion Analysis using NLP

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **sentiment and emotion analysis** from text using NLP techniques.  
The system predicts emotional dimensions and compares multiple machine learning models to evaluate performance.

We use handcrafted linguistic features and statistical methods to analyze emotional patterns in text.

## ⚙ Custom Feature Engineering

We extract **23 NLP-based custom features**, including:

- Word & sentence statistics  
- POS-based features (noun, verb, adjective, adverb)  
- Sentiment polarity  
- Positive, negative, and neutral word counts
